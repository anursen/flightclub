# flightclub

I know the holiday season is almost over. But if you are still searching for a cheap flight you can join my club to check for the cheapest flight you can find. 



On that project I used Python, OOP, KIWI API, Sheety API, Google Forms and lots of coffee.



Right now the project runs on Google Colab, If anyone of you guys have some more personal space on AWS Lambda. Let me know we can put the code there.



*You can get notified for only one location.

*You can only get the results for one way tickets.
